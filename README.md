Student Management System
Description
The Student Management System (SMS) is a console-based application that allows for the management of individual student records. The system can add, remove, search, and display students. Additionally, the system can read and write student data to a file, ensuring persistence of the student records. This system includes input validation to ensure the data is entered correctly, such as ensuring that no fields are left empty.

Features:
Student Class: Represents individual student records with attributes such as name, roll_number, grade, and other relevant details.
StudentManagementSystem Class: Manages a collection of students and provides methods to add, remove, search, display, and store student data.
User Interface: A simple console-based interface that allows users to interact with the system (e.g., add, edit, search, or display students).
File Storage: The system reads and writes student data to a file for persistence.
Input Validation: Ensures that user input is in the correct format and required fields are not empty.
